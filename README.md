Repository for GMLAB ST4 - Switchable Thru-box


ST4 is a "Four port Swtichable Thru Box", practically an easy and simple Midi Router, useful to control up to four synthesizers (or other MIDI devices) from one keyboard and switch quickly between them. Imagine you have one keyboard and up to four sound modules (synthesizers, drum machines, samplers, expanders, etc.) and you want to select which one you want to play from your keyboard. Just push the correspondent button and play, in any combination you like. The advantage of this box is that it will take into account notes still playing when the buttons are turned off, in order to avoid unwanted hung notes or incomplete Midi events. It can also function as a Usb-Midi interface.
